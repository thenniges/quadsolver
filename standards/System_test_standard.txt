We will system test using input redirection and diff. 
We will create a file with sample input and another file with expected results from the sample input.
We will run the program with the sample input directed into the program and the output directed to another file called actual.
We will then diff the expected results file with the actual file.
If anything is different it will output it.
We will write a script to do all of this automatically.
