This document will define our make standard for the quadsolver project

There will be one main makefile within the src directory that will build the final executable. There will also be makefiles within each sub-directory of src to create unit testing executables for each module of the project.

Every makefile should define the compiler and the c-flags at the top. The compiler should be defined as gcc and the c-flags should be defined as -ggdb -Wall -pedantic -std=c11

This is exactly what this should look like:

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -ggdb -Wall -pedantic -std=c11

There should be several lines to create the object files. You must explicitly specify the make rules, you cannot let them use the default.

This should look like this:

getIt.o: getIt/getIt.c getIt/getIt.h
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c getIt/getIt.c

Every makefile should only create one executable. This should be done by compiling each object file together.

This should look like this:

quadsolver: quadsolver.o getIt.o putIt.o format.o calculate.o validate.o
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} getIt.o putIt.o format.o calculate.o validate.o quadsolver.o -o quadsolver

Finally, every makefile should have a clean rule. It should remove the executable, the object files, and the core.

This should look like:

clean:
	rm -f *.o core quadsolve
